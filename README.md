## 🧠 Description about this project

 - Complete RTL-to-Layout Flow: Designed a low-power PicoRV32 ALU using open-source tools like Yosys, Graywolf, Qrouter, and OpenTimer.

- ML-Guided Optimization: Integrated machine learning models for hotspot detection, placement guidance, and area–power trade-off analysis.

- Power & Timing Efficiency: Achieved reduced IR-drop, improved placement, and better power–slack balance through iterative ML feedback.

- Poster Presentation: Presented the project at an intercollegiate event and earned a Special Mention Award with a cash prize.

- Open-Source & Reproducible: The entire flow is script-driven and reproducible, showcasing the potential of ML in physical design automation.
