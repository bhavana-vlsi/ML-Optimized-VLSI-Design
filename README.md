# ML-Optimized-VLSI-Design
Poster project on ML-guided physical design optimization using open-source VLSI tools. Special Mention Award winner.
# 🌟 ML-Optimized VLSI Design

This repository presents a complete RTL-to-layout flow for **low-power PicoRV32 ALU design**,
enhanced with **machine learning models** for physical design optimization.
The project was awarded a **Special Mention** with a cash prize during an intercollegiate poster presentation,
recognized among entries from six colleges.
